If you commit two files with same content here, they will be accessible using
Meteor's Asset API, but not with e.g. fs.readdir. This is important, because
the e2e tests in import.tests.js depend on this. If you have a test that
requires browsing the file system with one tree being a subtree of an other
(with some files having the same content), you need to put the common content
in a "common" path, and not anywhere else.
